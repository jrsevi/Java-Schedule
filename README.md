## Description

This is a schedule application that was made using HTML, CSS, Java Script, and JQeury.

## Usage
To use the Schedule Application, navigate to the time slot you wish to create an event. Click inside the middle row, write your event title, and then click the save button on the right of the corresponding row. After this, the event will be saved to your local storage and will be displayed on the schedule application until local storage is cleared.
